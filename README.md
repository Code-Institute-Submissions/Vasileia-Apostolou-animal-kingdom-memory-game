This project has been deployed to Github Pages from the master branch. A link to the deployed version of the site can be found [here](https://vasileia-apostolou.github.io/animal-kingdom-memory-game/).

All changes to the code were then added and committed to a local repository. The commits were then pushed to my GitHub repository. The project was hosted using GitHub pages directly from the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html. The process of deploying this project on GitHub pages can be seen as bellow; 

* Go to the settings tab of the repository, and scroll down to GitHub pages.
* Under GitHub pages, click on "source" and select the master branch.
